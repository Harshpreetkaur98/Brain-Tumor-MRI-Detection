# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Detection
Brain tumor detection from MRI scans using deep learning models like ResNet18 and EfficientNet-B0 to identify the most accurate architecture for tumor classification.

The model classifies the following tumor types:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary tumor

No tumor

The model is trained on MRI scans and focuses on identifying and differentiating these tumor classes based on features extracted from the brain images.
