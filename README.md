# Brain-tumour-MRI-Detection
Brain tumour detection from MRI scans using deep learning models like ResNet18 and EfficientNet-B0 to identify the most accurate architecture for tumour classification.

The model classifies the following tumour types:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary tumour
- No tumour

The model is trained on MRI scans and focuses on identifying and differentiating these tumour classes based on features extracted from the brain images.
